## Etimology

The word ANTIMA is a **portmanteau** word, which is a combination of the two names **Antônio** and **Fátima**, the names of my parents.

Because?

Because it's a tribute to the two smartest, bravest and kindest people in the world. They taught me the importance of intelligence, kindness, emotions. They gave me the best memories, which is why this project will be named after them. If one day this job changes any lives for good, it's because of them.
